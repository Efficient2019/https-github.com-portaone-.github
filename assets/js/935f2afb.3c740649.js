Open menu \\"My company \\\\> Portal users\\" and select a portal user for whom you need to define trusted IP addresses. Open tab \\"Security\\" and click \\"Add IP\\" to specify an IP address or network. You can add more than one trusted IP address or network.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Security/Blocking-phone-lines":{"id":"Security/Blocking-phone-lines","title":"Blocking phone lines","description":"Sometimes, you may need to block/unblock specific phone lines. For example, your company occasionally hires for seasonal sales campaigns. When a campaign ends and a specialist leaves, your company blocks their extension (the service provider doesn\u2019t charge a subscription fee for the days when a phone line is blocked). You may later unblock it when a specialist starts working again.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Security/PIN-protection-for-outgoing-paid-calls":{"id":"Security/PIN-protection-for-outgoing-paid-calls","title":"PIN protection for outgoing paid calls outside of your Cloud PBX","description":"Oftentimes, businesses require additional authorization for outgoing tolls on international calls.

PIN protection can be enabled for a particular product (main or add-on) assigned to extensions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Security/Two-factor-authentication":{"id":"Security/Two-factor-authentication","title":"Two-factor authentication","description":"You can significantly increase the security level of your portal users\' access to the Cloud PBX portal by using two-factor authentication (2FA). With enabled 2FA, users can log in only after entering a valid one-time password (OTP) in addition to their login and regular password. The time-based OTP is generated by a 2FA application, such as Google Authenticator, installed on the user\u2019s smartphone. So, even if an unauthorized person gains access to user credentials, they can\u2019t access the Cloud PBX portal without the OTP.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Wallboard":{"id":"Wallboard","title":"Wallboard","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
